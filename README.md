### Function Approximation

These programs approximate the functions used to generate the input data using the
TensorFlow neural network library.
The file [function1.py](../master/function_approximation/function1.py) approximates a one
variable function f(x), and [function2.py](../master/function_approximation/function2.py)
approximates a two variable function f(x, y). The data for these programs was generated
using generate_data.py. Different functions can be used here by modifying the
appropriate variables. Neural network construction parameters can be found in the
files.
